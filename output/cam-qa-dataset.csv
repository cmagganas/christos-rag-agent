38,Can you explain the concept of Generative AI and how Christos has been involved in its development?,"Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as images, text, or music, by learning patterns from existing data. It's a technology that's capable of producing something new, original, and realistic.

Christos has been actively involved in the development of Generative AI. He has worked on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) projects, contributing to the development of pioneering Generative AI applications. He has also explored the realms of Generative AI with hands-on experience in deploying LLM applications, teaching new structures to LLMs, and developing responsive Q&A tools. Furthermore, he has utilized tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex to advance Generative AI applications. His work at Learvo involved the development of an AI agent dedicated to assisting students in subjects like medicine by utilizing mnemonic devices, which is another application of Generative AI.","Christos'

53,What tasks did the Data Analyst at HCL Technologies perform using Google Cloud Platform?,"The Data Analyst at HCL Technologies performed several tasks using Google Cloud Platform. They built dashboards and performed ETL tasks on dispersed data sources, which allowed management to track progress and gain visibility. They also created dashboards using Data Studio to improve the efficiency of their engineers' time use. This individual took ownership of pipelines and analytical tools, maintaining well-documented instructions for processes and presenting results to non-technical individuals. They also provided ongoing and ad-hoc analysis on existing reports, writing two or three SQL scripts from scratch for ETL on a daily basis.","Reported natural gas price volatility for market changes versus historical data with visualizations for purchasing decisions daily.
